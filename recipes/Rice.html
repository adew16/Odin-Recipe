    <p> Extremely tasty Egg-fried rice</p>
    <P> This recipe is absolutely beginners friendly. Prep and ready in 20 mins</P>
    <h2><Strong>Ingredients</Strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>250g long grain rice</em></li>
        <li><em>3 tbsp vegetable oil</em></li>
        <li><em>1 onion, finely chopped</em></li>
        <li><em>4 eggs, beaten</em></li>
        <li><em>2 spring onions, sliced, to serve</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, spread it out to steam-dry and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned, around 5 mins. Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice â€“ stir vigorously to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve. You can also add sesame oil, ground white pepper and a splash of soy sauce to season.</li>
    </ol>
